    <h1>Why global warming needs more attention</h1>
   <p> When it comes to our changing climate, if we fail to reduce the fossil fuel emissions that are trapping the sun’s heat and warming our world, we will soon cross a threshold – and there will be no turning back. It’s just that simple.</p>

We know the consequences of inaction, and in the Paris Agreement, world leaders agreed to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius to avoid the very worst of these. But with oil insiders taking the place of climate champions in the US cabinet and other key federal positions, climate concerns have either been put on the backburner or are in the process of being undermined or rolled back in ways that favor Big Polluters like the coal and oil industries.

The relatively stable climate we’ve enjoyed since the last ice age has served as the foundation for civilization, making the crisis a truly existential threat. We simply can’t wait to take climate action.
